# KPMG-Virtual-Internship
I completed a virtual internship with KPMG focused on data analytics consulting. I was given a business problem involving an agency where I had to forecast future sales trends for bicycles and motorbikes. The dataset (an Excel file) contained multiple features to analyze.
The internship was structured into three modules:

1. Data cleaning and drafting a professional email to the client

2. Data visualization and creating a PowerPoint presentation

3. Identifying trends using graphs and building dashboards in Tableau

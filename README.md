# KPMG-Virtual-Internship
I did KPMG Internship virtually. It was about data analytics consulting. One business problem was given about the agency where I had to predict trends of sales of bicycles and motorbikes in the coming years. Data set(excel file) was provided with various features.
It consisted of 3 Modules
1. Data cleaning and email writing to client tasks
2. Data Visualization and power point presentation
3. Trends by graphs via Dashboards(Tableau)
